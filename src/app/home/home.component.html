          Technology has had a profound impact on agriculture throughout human
          history. Irrigation techniques, motorized farm equipment, plant
          genetics, and GPS are examples of advancements that have allowed
          farmers to cultivate and manage increasingly larger amounts of land,
          and provide fresh produce for billions around the globe. Kaprella
          aims to be the collaborative platform for licensors, marketers, and
          producers in a complex global industry that serves billions around
          the globe.
